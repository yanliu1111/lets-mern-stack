## Tech Stack:
- React
- Redux Toolkit (RTK) with RTK Query
- React Router
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Express
- Node.js (v20.10.0)
- Middleware
- Controllers
- CORS
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Authentication vs Authorization
- JWT for authentication
- Roles & Permissions

## Case study: 
### Case 1: Extending Data Cache Duration with Prefetching in RTK Query

1. In `userApiSlice.js`, the option `keepUnusedDataFor: 5` means that when there is no active subscription to the data, it will be removed from the cache after 5 seconds.  
   - If this line is removed, the default cache duration is 60 seconds.  
   - To keep an active subscription and maintain the data in the cache for a longer period, we need to implement a prefetch strategy.

2. In `EditUser.js`, we use `useSelector` and `selectUserById` to retrieve the user data directly from the Redux store.  
   - Since we only need the cached data here, **no active subscription** to the query is required.

3. To keep the data cached for a longer period, create an `auth/Prefetch.js` component.  
   - This component maintains an active subscription to the data even when no component is directly using it.  
   - (See the implementation details in `Prefetch.js`.)

4. In `app.js`, wrap the routes for `/dash/*` with the `<Prefetch />` component.  
   - This ensures the data stays ‚Äúwarm‚Äù in the cache and reduces unnecessary refetching.

### Case 2: Real-Time Updates Across Multiple Users‚Äô Screens

In this scenario, the application allows updates made in a single note form to be reflected for all listed users in real time.  
When more than one person is working with the same list of data, it‚Äôs important to have **up-to-date reference data** for any changes.

We can leverage **Redux RTK Query** to automatically re-mount and re-render components when updates occur.

#### Key Implementation Details:
- In `store.js`, `setupListeners(store.dispatch)` is configured to enable:
  - `refetchOnFocus` ‚Äì refetch data when the browser window regains focus.
  - `refetchOnReconnect` ‚Äì refetch data when the network reconnects.

- In `UserList.js` (similar to `NotesList.js`), configure the `useGetUsersQuery` hook to keep the data updated:

```js
const {
    data: users,
    isLoading,
    isSuccess,
    isError,
    error
} = useGetUsersQuery(undefined, {
    pollingInterval: 60000,            // fetch updates every 60 seconds
    refetchOnFocus: true,              // refetch on window focus
    refetchOnMountOrArgChange: true    // refetch when component remounts or args change
});
```

### Learning JWT Authentication and Authorization
- JWT is Json Web Token, access token and a refresh token
- Access token is short lived, usually 15 minutes to an hour
- Refresh token is long lived, usually a week or more
- Access token: sent as Json client stores in memory Do NOT store in local storage or cookies
- Refresh token: sent as HttpOnly cookie, not accessible from JS, Must have expiry at some point
- Access Token: Issued after Authentication, Client uses for API Access until expires, Verified with Middleware, New token issued with Refresh Token
- Refresh Token: Issued along with Access Token, Sent as HttpOnly cookie, Used to obtain new Access Token when expired, Verified with Middleware
